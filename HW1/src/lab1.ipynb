extract  suppose there exists a school with forty percent females and sixty percent males as students the female students can only wear skirts or trousers in equal numbers whereas all the male students can only wear trousers an observer randomly sees a student from a distance and all he can see is that this student is wearing trousers what is the probability this student is female  there is a debate amongst frequentists and bayesians about how bayes theorem plays a major role around the beginnings of statistical mathematics frequentist and bayesian explanations do not agree about the ways in which probabilities should be assigned this is primarily because bayesians assign probabilities in terms of beliefs whereas frequentists assign probabilities to random events according to the frequencies of them occurring ', 'dynamic programming is an algorithm design technique used for optimisation problems such as minimising or maximising like divide and conquer dynamic programming solves problems by combining solutions to sub problems however unlike divide and conquer sub problems are not always independent as sub problems may share sub sub problems but solution to one sub problem may not affect the solutions to other sub problems of the same problem  there are four steps in dynamic programming  1 characterise structure of an optimal solution  2 define value of optimal solution recursively  3 compute optimal solution values either top down with caching or bottom up in a table  4 construct an optimal solution from computed values  an example of the type of problem for which dynamic programming may be used is given two sequences x x1 xm and y y1 yn find a common subsequence whose length is maximum  dynamic programming reduces computation by solving sub problems in a bottom up fashion and by storing solution to a sub problem the first time it is solved also looking up the solution when a sub problem is encountered again helps reduce computation however the

originally coined the term in the 1940s to describe a method for solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another and by 1953 he refined his method to the current modern meaning  optimal substructure means that by splitting the programming into optimal solutions of subproblems these can then be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem one example is the computing of the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph first compute the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices then using this the best overall path can be found thereby demonstrating the dynamic programming principle this general three step process can be used to solve a problem  1 break up the problem different smaller subproblems  2 recursively use this three step process to compute the optimal path in the subproblem  3 construct an optimal solution using the computed optimal subproblems for the original problem  this process continues recursively working over the subproblems by dividing them into sub subproblems and so forth until a simple case is reached one that is easily solvable  ', 'inheritance in object oriented programming is where a new class is

to generalize du to the is a relationship between classes for example a cow is a generalization of animal similarly so are pigs  cheaters  defeining classes in this way allows us to define attributes and behaviours which are commen to all animals in one class so cheaters would natuarly inheart properities commen to all animals  the advantage of inheritance is that classes which would otherwise have alot of similar code  can instead shair the same code thus reducing the complexity of the program inheritance therefore can also be refered to as polymorphism which is where many pieces of code

which webpages are more important than others the algorithm considers the importance of a webpage to be reflected by how many other webpages link to that page and the importance of those pages  for each page that links to a page a the pagerank between zero and one is calculated iteratively according to the following two key factors the probability of a user navigating away from a page randomly the pagerank of any page that links to a divided by the total number of outbound links from that page this assumes that a link among many outbound links is less valuable than a link among fewer outbound links a variation of the pagerank method bases the importance of a webpage on how many visits the page gets  the method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise

documents take the form of bags of words  a standard information retrieval approach which represents documents as in a mathematical bag structure recording what terms are present and how often they occur  the vector space model is used in information retrieval to determine how similar documents are to one another and how similar documents are to a search query  in a collection of documents each document can be viewed as a vector of n values the terms in the document  where each term is an axis queries can also be represented as vectors on this vector space model and so deciding which document matches the query the closest becomes a matter of selecting the document vector which is nearest to the query vector  the query vector is compared to each document vector in turn using a vector similarity measure  which is the cosine of the angle between the query vector and the document vector  this equation is calculated by dividing the dot product of the query vector and the document vector by the modulus of the query vector multiplied by the modulus of the document vector the denominator takes into account differences in the length of the vector and has the effect of normalising the length whichever document returns the highest cosine similarity score is considered to be the closest matching document to the query  ', 'in probability theory bayes theorem relates

dynamic programming is an optimal method of solving the problems and takes much less time than na ve methods  dynamic programming uses the properties of optimal substructure overlapping subproblems and memoization to create an algorithm to solve such problems optimal substructure means that the structure of the problem is made up of sub problems which can be used to find the solution to the problem overall a problem with overlapping subproblems means that the same subproblems may be used to solve many different larger problems each sub problem is solved by being divided into sub subproblems until a case is reached which is solvable in constant time memoization stores solutions which have already been computed in order to reduce unnecessary re computation  dynamic programming can be divided into two main approaches top down and bottom up the top down approach breaks the problem into subproblems which are solved and remembered using a combination of memoization and recursion the bottom up approach solves all subproblems that might be need in advance and then uses these solutions to build up the solutions to the bigger problem  ', 'when we talk about inheritance

computing these values aka term weights have been developed one of the best known schemes is tf idf weighting  the way that a term is defined depends on the application typically terms are single words keywords or sometimes even longer phrases if the words are chosen as the terms the number of dimensions in the vector is the number of distinct words in the corpus  relevancy ranks for documents

the query is represented as same format vector as the documents  generally it is easier to calculate the cosine of the angle between the vectors instead of the angle itself a zero value for the cosine indicates that the query and document vector are orthogonal and so had no match this means the query term did not exist in the document being considered  however the vector space model has limitations long documents are poorly represented due to their poor similarity values a small scalar product and a large dimensionality  search keywords must match precisely the document terms word substrings

breaks a large problem down into smaller subproblems and generally allows for the finding of the optimal solution when the problem is split into subproblems these themselves may be split into smaller problems and so on until they cannot be reduced any more it is also common for dynamic programming to make use of recursion and the saving of previous results for faster computation later this also leads to higher efficiency as calculations are not being redone for example when a problem is reduced into sub problems and those are then reduced further it may be that there are common subsubproblems and so only one calculation needs to be done and the result saved to help solve more than one subproblem an example of this gain in efficiency is a path finding problem if there are two distinct routes in a network of 10 nodes tagged a to j then if the two routes share a common section say between nodes b and d  the cost of that section should be calculated for the first route and saved then when the second route is being processed the cost of b to d does not need to be calculated again in general dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems where the most efficient

programming where a child or sub class inherits characteristics from a parent or super class  the concept takes its name from genetic inheritance where a child can inherit genetic characteristics from its parents  inheritance at its simplest allows programmers to model a relationship where one object is a kind of another  for instance two classes one representing an undergraduate student and another representing a post graduate student could both be said to belong to a more generalised class representing all students  similarly we could say that dogs and cats are two kinds of animal or that bridges and skyscrapers are two types of man made structure  subclasses are said to extend or specialise their superclasses  attributes variables and behaviours functions that are common between classes can be included in the definition of the superclass leaving the subclass definitions containing only the attributes and behaviours that are unique to that class  inheritance can be used to create a multiple level architecture of classes  in such an architecture even the bottom most subclasses inherit all of the attributes and behaviours that are defined in the very top most superclasses

number of web sites that link to that page taking into account the importance value or pagerank of those pages  the pagerank is computed iteratively and it is found that the pagerank values converge

bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another by 1953 he had refined this to the modern meaning the field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the ieee bellman s contribution is remembered in the name of the bellman equation a central result of dynamic programmer which restates an optimization problem in recursive form the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming in general  and instead of this it comes from the term mathematical programming  a synonym for optimization therefore the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for example a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program  optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for instance the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices after this it is using this to pick the best overall path in a word we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process ', 'the idea of inheritance in oop refers to the formation of new classes with the already existing classes the concept of inheritance was basically formulated for simula in 1967 as a result the newly created inherited or derived classes inherit the properties and behavior of the classes from which they are derived these original classes are either called base classes or sometimes referred to as ancestor classes the idea of inheritance is to reuse the existing code with little or no modification at all the basic support provided by inheritance is that it represents by categorization in computer languages the power mechanism number of information processing that is crucial to human learning by the means of generalization and cognitive economy is called categorization where generalization if the knowledge of specific entities and is applied to a wider group provided that belongs relation can be created on the other hand cognitive economy is where less information needs to be stored about each specific entity except for some particularities there are examples where we can have modules with similar interfaces the advantage that inheritance provides is that it makes such modules share a lot of code which consequently reduces the complexity of the program ', 'pagerank is a probability distribution used to represent the likelihood that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any particular page  it is assumed in several research papers that the distribution is evenly divided between all documents in the collection at the beginning of the computational process pagerank can be calculated for collections of documents of any size the pagerank computations require several passes called iterations  through the collection to adjust approximate pagerank values to more closely reflect the theoretical true value a probability is expressed as a numeric value between 0 and 1 a 0 5 probability is commonly expressed as a 50 chance of something happening hence a pagerank of 0 5 means there is a 50 chance that a person clicking on a random link will be directed to the document with the 0 5 pagerank simplified algorithm how pagerank works assume a small universe of four web pages a b c and d the initial approximation of pagerank would be evenly divided between these four documents hence each document would begin with an estimated pagerank of 0 25 in the original form of pagerank initial values were simply 1 this meant that the sum of all pages was the total number of pages on the web later versions of pagerank see the below formulas would assume a probability distribution between 0 and 1 here we re going to simply use a probability distribution hence the initial value of 0 25 ', 'in vector space model the documents from which the information is to be retrieved are represented as vectors the term weighting indentifies the success or failure of the vector space method terms are basically the words or any indexing unit used to identify the contents of a text furthermore a term weighting scheme plays an important role for the similarity measure the similarity measures largely identify the retrieval efficiency of a particular information retrieval system  this largely depends on formulas where the formulas depend only on the frequencies within the document and they not depend on inter document frequencies the main components of the formulas are as follows binary binary formula gives every word that appears in a document equal relevance this can be useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important term frequency this formula counts how many times the term occurs in a document the more times a term t occurs in document d the more likely it is that t is relevant to the document used alone favors common words and long documents this formula gives more credit to words that appears more frequently but often too much credit augmented normalized term frequency this formula tries to give credit to any word that appears and then give some additional credit to words that appear frequently logarithmic term frequency logarithms are a way to de emphasize the e ect of frequency literature proposes log and alternate log as the most used ', 'bayes theorem is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities bayes theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the reverend thomas bayes it figures prominently in subjectivist or bayesian approaches to epistemology statistics and inductive logic it can be seen as a way of understanding how the probability that a theory is true is affected by a new piece of evidence it has been used in a wide variety of contexts ranging from marine biology to the development of bayesian spam blockers for email systems in the philosophy of science it has been used to try to clarify the relationship between theory and evidence many insights in the philosophy of science involving confirmation falsification the relation between science and pseudosience and other topics can be made more precise and sometimes extended or corrected by using bayes theorem subjectivists who maintain that rational belief is governed by the laws of probability lean heavily on conditional probabilities in their theories of evidence and their models of empirical learning bayes theorem is central to these enterprises both because it simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities and because it clarifies significant features of subjectivist position indeed the theorem s central insight that a hypothesis is confirmed by any body of data that its truth renders probable is the cornerstone of all subjectivist methodology ', 'dynamic programming is a method of providing solutions to potential problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping sub problems and optimal structure this is highly used in dynamic programming the advantage being the less time consumption in comparison to other amateur methods it has to be kept in mind that the term programming in the field has got nothing to do with computer programming at all on the other hand it is derived from the term mathematical programming which is a similar word used for optimization here by meaning that a program can be an optimal plan for the produced action the typical example could be of a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition this leads to the concept of programming being a helper in finding an acceptable plan of action which can also be termed as an algorithm the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time overlapping subproblems means that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems example could be of fibonacci sequence f3  f1  f2 and f4  f2  f3 computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more it means that whenever we encounter with overlapping subproblems a naive approach may waste to e recomputing optimal solutions to the already solved subproblems ', 'object oriented programming is a style of programming that supports encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism inheritance means

probabilities should be assigned in applications frequentists assign probabilities to random events according to their frequencies of occurrence or to subsets of populations as proportions of the

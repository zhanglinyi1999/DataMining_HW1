      " in mathematics and computer science dynamic programming is a method of solving problems that exhibit the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure described below  the method takes much less time than naive methods the term was originally used in the 1940s by richard bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another by 1953 he had refined this to the modern meaning the field was founded as a systems analysis and engineering topic that is recognized by the ieee bellman s contribution is remembered in the name of the bellman equation a central result of dynamic programming which restates an optimization problem in recursive form the word programming in dynamic programming has no particular connection to computer programming at all and instead comes from the term mathematical programming  a synonym for optimization thus the program is the optimal plan for action that is produced for instance a finalized schedule of events at an exhibition is sometimes called a program programming in this sense means finding an acceptable plan of action an algorithm optimal substructure means that optimal solutions of subproblems can be used to find the optimal solutions of the overall problem for example the shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path as shown in figure 1 in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3 use these optimal solutions to construct an optimal solution for the original problem the subproblems are themselves solved by dividing them into sub subproblems and so on until we reach some simple case that is solvable in constant time figure 2 the subproblem graph for the fibonacci sequence that it is not a tree but a dag indicates overlapping subproblems to say that a problem has overlapping subproblems is to say that the same subproblems are used to solve many different larger problems for example in the fibonacci sequence f3  f1  f2 and f4  f2  f3  computing each number involves computing f2 because both f3 and f4 are needed to compute f5 a naive approach to computing f5 may end up computing f2 twice or more this applies whenever overlapping subproblems are present a naive approach may waste time recomputing optimal solutions to subproblems it has already solved in order to avoid this we instead save the solutions to problems we have already solved then if we need to solve the same problem later we can retrieve and reuse our already computed solution this approach is called memoization not memorization although this term also fits  if we are sure we won t need a particular solution anymore we can throw it away to save space in some cases we can even compute the solutions to subproblems we know that we ll need in advance \n",

new classes to reuse the methods and variables of the existing classes and new methods and classes are added to specialise the new class inheritance models the is kind of relationship between entities or objects  for example postgraduates and undergraduates are both kinds of student this kind of relationship can be visualised as a tree structure where student would be the more general root node and both postgraduate and undergraduate would be more specialised extensions of the student node or the child nodes  in this relationship student would be known as the superclass or parent class whereas  postgraduate would be known as the subclass or child class because the postgraduate class extends the student class  inheritance can occur on several layers where if visualised would display a larger tree structure for example we could further extend the postgraduate node by adding two extra extended classes to it called  msc student and phd student as both these types of student are kinds of postgraduate student this would mean that both the msc student and phd student classes would inherit methods and variables from both the postgraduate and student classes  ', 'pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by the google internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents such as the world wide web with the purpose of measuring its relative importance within the set google assigns a numeric weighting from 0 10 for each webpage on the internet this pagerank denotes a site s importance in the eyes of google  the pagerank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the richter scale the pagerank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the pagerank of the pages providing the links the algorithm may be applied to any collection of entities with reciprocal quotations and references the numerical weight that it assigns to any given element e is also called the pagerank of e and denoted by pr e  it is known that other factors e g relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the google toolbar also influence the pagerank  other link based ranking algorithms for web pages include the hits algorithm invented by jon kleinberg used by teoma and now ask com  the ibm clever project and the trustrank algorithm  ', 'the vector space model also called term vector model is an algebraic model used to represent text documents as well as any objects in general as vectors of identifiers it is used in information retrieval and was first used in the smart information retrieval system  a document is represented as a vector and each dimension corresponds to a separate term if a term appears in the document then its value in the vector is non zero many different ways of calculating these values also known as term weights have been developed one of the best known methods is called tf idf weighting  the definition of term depends on the application but generally terms are single words keywords or longer phrases if the words are chosen to be the terms the dimensionality of the vector is the number of words in the vocabulary which is the number of distinct words occurring in the corpus  the vector space model has several disadvantages firstly long documents are represented badly because they have poor similarity values secondly search keywords must accurately match document terms and substrings of words might result in a false positive match  thirdly documents with similar context but different term vocabulary will not be associated resulting in a false negative match  finally the order in which the terms appear in the document is lost in the vector space representation  ', 'bayes theorem was names after rev thomas bayes and is a method used in probability theory this theorem aims to relate the conditional and marginal probabilities of two random events occuring and given various observations is frequently used to compute subsequent probabilities bayes theorem is also often known as bayes law  an example of where bayes theorem may be used is in the following extract  suppose there exists a school with forty percent females and sixty percent males as students the female students can only wear skirts or trousers in equal numbers whereas all the male students can only wear trousers an observer randomly sees a student from a distance and all he can see is that this student is wearing trousers what is the probability this student is female  there is a debate amongst frequentists and bayesians about how bayes theorem plays a major role around the beginnings of statistical mathematics frequentist and bayesian explanations do not agree about the

solution recursively  3 compute optimal solution values either top down with caching or bottom up in a table  4 construct an optimal solution from computed values  an example of the type of problem for which dynamic programming may be used is given two sequences x x1 xm and y y1 yn find a common subsequence whose length is maximum  dynamic programming reduces computation by solving sub problems

decision making stage without a proof of correctness such an algorithm is likely to fail with dynamic programming we can design our own algorithm which searches for all possibilities which ensures correctness whilst storing the results to avoid having to recomputed leading to computational efficiency  dynamic programming solves problems by combining the solutions of subproblems these subproblems are not however independent subproblems can share subsubproblems but the solution to one subproblem doesn t necessarily affect the solutions to other subproblems stemming from the same problem dynamic programming reduces computation time by solving subproblems in a bottom up way it stores the solution to a subproblem the first time it is solved meaning that it can look up the solution when that subproblem is encountered subsequently  the key to dynamic programming is to find the structure of optimal solutions the steps required are as follows 1 generalise the structure of

detail  this is carried out by allowing the new class to reuse the existing class methods and variables whilst also creating class specific methods and variables this means that the new class the subclass is a more specialised version of the original or superclass  because of this it means that the subclass can use all the public methods and variables from the superclass however any private methods or variables are still private  also it should be noted that a class can only extend one class e g can only be a subclass to one superclass however a superclass can have more then one subclass and a class can both be a subclass and a superclass if this occurs then all of the non private methods and variables can be used by the most specialised class  this means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass then the subclass es then extend these to add more detail an example of this could be using a superclass of employee and then to have two subclasses called fulltime and part time as employee could have name address and other details whilst full time could just have salary and part time could work out the salary from part time

shortest path to a goal from a vertex in a graph can be found by first computing the shortest path to the goal from all adjacent vertices and then using this to pick the best overall path in general we can solve a problem with optimal substructure using a three step process 1 break the problem into smaller subproblems 2 solve these problems optimally using this three step process recursively 3

document can be viewed as a vector of n values the terms in the document  where each term is an axis queries can also be represented as vectors on this vector space model and so deciding which document matches the query the closest becomes a matter of selecting the document vector which is nearest to the query vector  the query vector is compared to each document vector in turn using a vector similarity measure  which is the cosine of the angle between the query vector and the document vector  this equation is calculated by dividing the dot product of the query vector and the

another representing a post graduate student could both be said to belong to a more generalised class representing all students  similarly we could say that dogs and cats are two kinds of animal or that bridges and skyscrapers are two types of man made structure  subclasses are said to extend or specialise their superclasses  attributes variables and behaviours functions that are common between classes can be included in the definition of the superclass leaving the subclass definitions containing only the attributes and behaviours that are unique to that class  inheritance can be used to create a multiple level architecture of classes  in such an architecture even the bottom most subclasses inherit all of the attributes and behaviours that are defined in the very top most superclasses

useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important term frequency this formula counts how many times the term occurs in a document the more times a term t occurs in document d the more likely it is that t is relevant to the document used alone favors common words and long documents this formula gives more credit to words that appears more frequently but often too much
